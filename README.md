# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Report

Introduction:
In tackling the front-end web development assignment, my goal was clear: address a common issue within our community by creating a platform that simplifies the discovery and participation in local events. The outcome is EventsByU, a user-friendly website designed to foster community connections through shared experiences.

Main Section:
The choice to focus on events was driven by the belief that they serve as powerful catalysts for community bonding. EventsByU is intended to be a straightforward solution, allowing community members to effortlessly discover and share local happenings, thereby strengthening the communal fabric. In the development process, simplicity and user-friendliness were at the forefront. Utilizing React for structure and Tailwind CSS for styling, the project was completed without relying on external APIs, showcasing the capability to create impactful solutions as a student.

Conclusion:
EventsByU is more than just a website; it symbolizes the potential of student-driven initiatives to address real-world challenges. Representing the core features needed for a community-driven events platform, it stands as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with room for growth and improvement. As a starting point, EventsByU is open to feedback and enhancements, with the vision of continually better serving our community in the future. This project demonstrates that impactful solutions can be crafted without complexity, and as a student, I look forward to further refining and expanding EventsByU based on community needs.
